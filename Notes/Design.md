# Design

The design process are the steps that we take when we create a solution to a problem

There are four steps in our design process

## 1. Design our Algorithm in English (or smt else)
An algorithm is a sequence of steps to solve a problem
In this class, before we start any programming, we write our steps in English

# 2. Translate our Algorithm from English to Python
We'll translate our algorithm into "proper" python

# 3. Test our Python Algorithm
Check if it works *syntactically*. In other words, we check to see if it BREAKS
In other words we ask does our algorithm actually solve the problem.

# 4. Share our work
