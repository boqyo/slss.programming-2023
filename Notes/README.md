# Crude Chatbot
Shaun HA
https://github.com/boqyo

Create a chatbot based on the examples in class. The chatbot should start when you run the Python file.

> **Before you start any work, Mr. Ubial will show you how to create a new branch to develop your solution.**
> **Do not start until you've created a new branch.**

Included in the repository is a `main.py` file. This is where you're going to work.

## Requirements

* It should ask at least 3 questions.
* It must use if/elif/else at least once.
* It must use an answer from the user in its response at least once.

## Process

Follow the design rhythm that we talked about in class.

> Design your algorithm in English first, then translate it to Python code. Test as you go!

## Delivery

When you're finished, create a pull request into the main branch. There are two outcomes, you'll either be told to make changes, or the commits will be merged into the main branch.
