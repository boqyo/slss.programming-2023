In Python, data can be grouped in categories called Types

|  Name  | Example      |
|  ----  | ----         |
| String | "hello"      |
| List   | [1, 2, 3, 4] |
| int.   | 1  -10       |
| flaot. | 3.5  -2.3    |
| boolean or bool | True false |

An example of using these types of data:

```python
favourite_food = "tempura"
my_age = 16      # my_age is of type int or integer
```

## [Converting Types](https://github.com/teacherubial/slss-programming-2023-24/blob/main/Notes/Type.md#converting-types)

There are some **special functions** built in to Python that helps to convert data from one type to another.

```python
intro_string = "My age is"
my_age = 16

# Recall
"My name is" + "Jim"        # "My name isJim"
"My name is" + " " + "Jim"  # "My name is Jim"
intro_string + my_age       # This is going to BREAK
```
