# Natural Language Processing

## Output 
We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen
We use whats called the `print()` function to display output 

```python
print("your text goes in here")
```


## Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are *not* interpreted by python
This means that the text is ignored 
We use the hash symbol to make comments
```python
# This is a comment
```
