# Natural Language Processing

## Output 
We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen
We use whats called the `print()` function to display output 

```python
print("your text goes in here")
```


## Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are *not* interpreted by python
This means that the text is ignored 
We use the hash symbol to make comments
```python
# This is a comment
```

	Task
	1. In Input and Output



# Input
We can grab information from the user using the input( ).
When we run the function, it does two things
1. it waits for the user to write something or nothing
2. the user pressed **Enter/Return** to indicate that they're finished

```Python
input()

input(<prompt>)            # prints out the prompt
```

# Variables
variables allow us to store information for the time that our app is running

```python
favorite_food = input("what is your favorite food? ")
```


favorite_food = the name of the variable

= = assignment operator

input = value

# Variables

## Naming
What you can do
1. name them with letters, numbers, underscores
2. name should start with a lowercase letter
What you **cant** do
1. you cant name them with spaces or symbols
2. you cant name them with certain names that are reserved

A good name is something like this

```python
favorite_food
fav_food
food
date_of_birth
name_of_user

```

Bad names 
```python
Favorite_food
aa
aaaa
aaaaaa
asadasfasf
dafhhadfhadh
```
