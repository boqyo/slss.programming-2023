A list in Python is a collection of items
We can store different values in a list

# Creating A List
To make a list, we use brackets \[\[]] to surround out list
We seperate the items using ,


```python
some_list = "John", "Tim", "Micheal"
```
# Access Elements in a List
We can grab things from lists using the bracket notation
In our example above, if I wanted to access "Tim", I would do 

```python
some_list[1].     # tim
some_list[2].     # Micheal
some_list[-1].    # Micheal
some_list[-2].    # Tim
```

Inside the brackets, we say the index of the value we want 
Python uses 0-index counting, which means we start counting at 0
